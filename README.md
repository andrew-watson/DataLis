Testing methods to explore data through sound.

My aim is to be able to explore and experience normal data through sound. It is mainly for interest, but could be used as a learning tool to internalise mathematical functions and their relationships.

My initial experiments and roadmap can be found in the iPython notebook, and any useful output and use cases will be made into separate Python scripts.
